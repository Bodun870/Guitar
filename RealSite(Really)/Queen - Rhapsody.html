                Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?<br/>
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality<br/>
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see<br/>
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br/>
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low<br/>
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me<br/><br/>
Mama, just killed a man<br/>
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br/>
Mama, life had just begun<br/>
But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br/>
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry<br/>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br/>
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters<br/><br/>
Too late, my time has come<br/>
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time<br/>
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go<br/>
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br/>
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)<br/>
I don't wanna die<br/>
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all<br/><br/>
I see a little silhouetto of a man<br/>
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?<br/>
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me<br/>
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnifico<br/>
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me<br/>
He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br/>
Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br/><br/>
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?<br/>
No, we will not let you go (let him go)<br/>

We will not let you go (let him go)<br/>

We will not let you go (let me go)<br/>
Will not let you go (let me go)<br/>
Never, never, never, never let me go<br/>
No, no, no, no, no, no, no<br/><br/>
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia<br/>
Mamma mia, let me go<br/>
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me<br/><br/>
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?<br/>
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?<br/>
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby<br/>
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here<br/><br/>
Ooh<br/>
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah<br/><br/>
Nothing really matters, anyone can see<br/>
Nothing really matters<br/>
Nothing really matters to me<br/>
