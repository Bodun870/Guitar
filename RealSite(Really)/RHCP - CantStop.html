                Can't stop, addicted to the shindig<br/>
                Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big<br/>
                Choose not a life of imitation<br/>
                Distant cousin to the reservation<br/>
                Defunct, the pistol that you pay for<br/>
                This punk, the feelin' that you stay for<br/>
                In time, I want to be your best friend<br/>
                East Side love is living on the West End<br/><br/>
                Knocked out, but boy, you better come to<br/>
                Don't die, you know, the truth is some do<br/>
                Go write your message on the pavement<br/>
                Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant<br/>
                White heat is screamin' in the jungle<br/>
                Complete the motion if you stumble<br/>
                Go ask the dust for any answers<br/>
                Come back strong with 50 belly dancers<br/><br/>
                The world I love, the tears I drop<br/>
                To be part of the wave, can't stop<br/>
                Ever wonder if it's all for you?<br/>
                The world I love, the trains I hop<br/>
                To be part of the wave, can't stop<br/>
                Come and tell me when it's time to<br/><br/>
                Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone<br/>
                So smart, she's leading me to ozone<br/>
                Music, the great communicator<br/>
                Use two sticks to make it in the nature<br/>
                I'll get you into penetration<br/>
                The gender of a generation<br/>
                The birth of every other nation<br/>
                Worth your weight, the gold of meditation<br/><br/>
                This chapter's gonna be a close one<br/>
                Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one<br/>
                All on a spaceship, persevering<br/>
                Use my hands for everything but steering<br/>
                Can't stop the spirits when they need you<br/>
                Mop tops are happy when they feed you<br/>
                J. Butterfly is in the treetop<br/>
                Birds that blow the meaning into bebop<br/><br/>    
                The world I love, the tears I drop<br/>
                To be part of the wave, can't stop<br/>
                Ever wonder if it's all for you?<br/>
                The world I love, the trains I hop<br/>
                To be part of the wave, can't stop<br/>
                Come and tell me when it's time to<br/><br/>
                Wait a minute, I'm passin' out, win or lose<br/>
                Just like you<br/>
                Far more shocking than anything I ever knew<br/>
                How about you?<br/>
                Ten more reasons why I need somebody new<br/>
                Just like you<br/>
                Far more shocking than anything I ever knew<br/>
                Right on cue<br/><br/>
                Can't stop, addicted to the shindig<br/>
                Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big<br/>
                Choose not a life of imitation<br/>
                Distant cousin to the reservation<br/>
                Defunct, the pistol that you pay for<br/>
                This punk, the feelin' that you stay for<br/>
                In time, I want to be your best friend<br/>
                East Side love is living on the West End<br/><br/>
                Knocked out, but boy, you better come to<br/>
                Don't die, you know, the truth is some do<br/>
                Go write your message on the pavement<br/>
                Burn so bright, I wonder what the wave meant<br/><br/>
                Kick-start the golden generator<br/>
                Sweet talk but don't intimidate her<br/>
                Can't stop the gods from engineering<br/>
                Feel no need for any interfering<br/>
                Your image in the dictionary<br/>
                This life is more than ordinary<br/>
                Can I get two, maybe even three of these?<br/>
                Comin' from space to teach you of the Pleiades<br/><br/>
                Can't stop the spirits when they need you<br/>
                This life is more than just a read-through<br/>
